Bike fit notes:
Hey Brandon, hope things are good with you! Sorry this isn't too far ahead of time, but I scheduled a fit on my mountain bike and had some notes on what I'm looking for that I wanted to share before my appointment.

I'm looking to get fixed on my mtb, an older on one scandal. . It's a fixed setup. Currently have some bullmoose bars on it but can bring two more standard bars to swap. Looking at getting some new components but want to make sure I'm addressing fit issues I may have. Are there swappable parts there to try, or will I need to purchase components from Blue Ridge to try them out during the session? After the session if there are parts I want to change, 

It's kind of a silly thing, but been using this bike for bikepacking and longer rides. Planning to do mtncat on it too. Would love to leave the option to put aerobars on it, but not too pressed on it.

Issues I've had in the past, in general:
1. Super sore lower neck/upper back after ~2hr of riding.
2. Lower back pain when riding trail (from using back too much to push heavy gear?)
3. Hand numbness/fatigue

Issues I've had with this bike specifically:
During longer day bikepacking, had some knee pain below the kneecap in my left knee. Adjusted seat/seat height, felt good for ~a day until my achilles felt real sore, and became even more inflamed. Want to avoid that in the future.

Is there additional cost for getting fit on a second bike? Would I be able to come back and get fit on another bike using my measurements? Wanted to understand what that meant on the website.
